# CloudflareDDNS Module - Updates and Fixes

This document describes recent updates and fixes to the CloudflareDDNS PowerShell module.

## Recent Fixes

### 1. Enhanced DNS Update Feedback

The module now provides proper feedback when updating DNS records through the interactive menu. Previously, the update operation would just output "True" without providing meaningful information.

- Added detailed success messages showing both previous and new IP address
- Improved error messages with specific reasons for failures
- Better console output formatting with color-coding for easier reading

### 2. Improved Error Handling

- Added more comprehensive error detection in DNS record retrieval
- Better placeholder credential detection to prevent API errors
- More descriptive error messages for configuration issues

### 3. Enhanced Logging System

- Updated the logging system to support dual output to both log files and console
- Color-coded console messages based on severity (errors in red, success in green, etc.)
- Formatted output for better readability

## Usage Tips

### Configuration

Before using the module, make sure to properly configure your Cloudflare credentials:

1. From the main menu, select **Option 5: View/Edit configuration**
2. Either edit the configuration directly or use **Option 2** to learn how to create a Cloudflare API token
3. Ensure your Zone ID and API Token are correctly set

### Updating DNS Records

To update your DNS records:

1. From the main menu, select **Option 1: Update DNS record now**
2. The system will:
   - Detect your current public IP address
   - Check your existing Cloudflare DNS record
   - Update the record if needed
   - Display detailed results

### Troubleshooting

If you encounter errors:

1. Make sure your Cloudflare API token has the correct permissions (Zone:DNS:Edit and Zone:Zone:Read)
2. Verify your Zone ID is correct
3. Check your internet connection
4. Review the log files (Option 3 from the main menu)
